# Code style and guides:

- We are using `uv` to manage packages and run our [unreal_mcp_server.py](mdc:UNREAL/Python/unreal_mcp_server.py)
- For mcp.tools(), do not use `Optional` as it is not supported by most MCP clients. Instead, use the default to None pattern and deal with defaults within the method definition itself.
- Add docstring to methods defined.
