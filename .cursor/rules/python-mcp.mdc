- For mcp.tool() decorated methods, do not use `Optional`, or `Union`, or `| None = None` or `Any` for parameters, as it is not supported by most MCP clients. Instead, use the default to None pattern and deal with defaults within the method definition itself. But you still need to have a type listed.
